# OSI

## Layer 1: Physical
* Repeater (Ethernet)
* Hub (Ethernet)


## Layer 2: Data Link
* Switching/bridges (not much of a difference when you dig into it, both can be learning)
=> Switches and bridges connect segments as if they are a single network (<=> routers allows networks to communicate independently)

* Access Point (Wifi): Bridges WLan to ethernet (thus must understand frames)

## Layer 3: Network
* Routing

## On all layers
* Multiplexing
