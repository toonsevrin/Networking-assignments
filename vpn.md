# VPN
## Layer 2
Example: VLan over the internet. Appears like its "one" network.

## Layer 3
Example: Connect networks running a private IP (thus only locally unique addresses) to eachother over the Internet.

Appears like it's "one" internetwork. Is the tunneling logic handled by the nodes or by the router?
