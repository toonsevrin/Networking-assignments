# a3p4 VLAN
VLANs partition an extended LAN into seperate logical LANs. Frames cannot transfer between two different logical LANs.

## What if nodes on two seperate VLANs want to communicate?
If they don't want to setup another VLAN they will have to use a layer 3 protocol for this. Thus a router is required. In the image provided in the slides of this question, it is not clear whether or not a router is present.
