# How can switches help with the increase of ethernet bandwidth

## Store- and forward instead of collision detection
Because each node has it's own dedicated link (usually two links for each direction of data flow), there is no need for collision detection. Not only do we no longer need to share the medium, the packet size trade-off is no longer relevant (see [A2p4](https://github.com/toonsevrin/Networking-assignments/tree/master/A2p4-Ethernet)).

## Going even faster (100gbps...)
- Multiple lanes (instead of 2, use 4,6..)
- Faster medium (optical fiber...)
